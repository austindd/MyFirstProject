        <h1>Hello world!!!</h1>
            <p>It's quite nice to meet you. I like to hike and climb rocks. I won't be here long, though!</p>
            <img src="Images\Rock Climbing (Standard Variation V6).JPG" height ="100px" alt="Me climbing rocks">
        <h2>Goodbye world!!!</h2>
            <p>It's been a real pleasure, but I really don't know you that well, so I'm not that torn up about it.</p>
        <h3>Wait, I'm back again world!!!</h3>
            <p>All right stop, collaborate and listen.</p>
        <h4>Ice is back with a brand new invention!!!</h4>
            <p>Something grabs a hold of me tightly. Flow like a harpoon daily and nightly.</p>
            <p>Will it ever stop? Yo, I don't know. Turn off the lights and I'll glow.</p>
            <p>To the extreme I rock a mic like a vandal. Light up a stage and wax a chump like a candle.</p>
        <h5>Don't call it a comeback!!!</h5>
            <p>I'm just here because I forgot my keys.</p>
        <h6>Ok but for real this time, bye.</h6>
            <p>Oh yeah, one more paragraph for the HTML lab project. K bye!</p>
